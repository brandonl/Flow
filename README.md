Flow is an OpenGL3 framework to aid in expirementing, mainly, with GLSL shaders. It includes wrappers around most of the OpenGL core profile functionality. Using Flow allows one to easily load and switch between shaders and meshes. It also includes a first person camera to move about the scene and explore the meshes.


Flow utilizes OpenGL Core profile, GLSL, and GLFW and was written in C++(11).
